Introduction - Time Series Model for Housing Price Index

Predicting housing prices is a crucial aspect of economic analysis and decision-making, given its significance for policymakers, investors, and individuals. 
Housing prices reflect the broader economic climate, including interest rates, employment conditions, and consumer confidence. Accurate predictions of housing price movements enable individuals to make informed home-buying or selling choices.

In this context, time series modeling offers a robust framework for forecasting housing prices with follow benefits,

Unlike traditional regression models that assume independence among observations
Time series models are explicitly designed to account for temporal dependencies within data
Time series can capture patterns such as trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation, which are often present in housing prices
Time series analysis allows us to incorporate lagged effects, reflecting how past housing prices influence current and future market behavior
For this study, we aim to leverage advanced time series modeling techniques, including ARIMA and its variants, to forecast the Canadian Housing Price Index (HPI). 
The HPI serves as a reliable measure of changes in the price of residential properties over time. Using historical data, our model incorporates both short-term dynamics and long-term trends to generate accurate and actionable predictions.
